## Introduction
Welcome to my Mechanical Engineering Design Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my work in mechanical engineering design, encompassing various projects, concepts, and achievements. As a passionate and detail-oriented mechanical engineer, I am dedicated to developing novel and innovative solutions to real-world challenges where precedent is lacking.

## Projects
### Project 1: [Syringe Plunger Stopper Pin]
After the Cytiva machine fills syringes with liquid drug product, the containers are sealed under partial vacuum by inserting a rubber plunger into the neck of the syringe using a stopper pin. Where previous iterations failed, a novel stopper pin was designed to dis-allow suction of the plunger to the stopper pin when the vacuum is released.

### Project 2: [Vacuum Pick and Place Station]
The Cytiva machine processes 'nested arrays' of injection molded trays containing up to 100 vials. To pick these nests, a new vacuum post was designed making use of oval suction cups which were commonly used to pick and place compoennts in electronics manufacturing. These oval cups made use of precious space on the nest edge to maximise the suction force of the vacuum arm to safely pick the filled nest.

### Project 3: [Fill Volume Verification Post]
When drug product is dispensed into a vial in the Cytiva machine, the dispense volume is weighed by taring the weight of an empty vial before dispensing. A post was extended off the scale to isolate a single vial from the nest to allow for this weight measurement. The final design was fairly simple in shape but encompassed a complex tolerance stack up taking into account robot arm positional repeatability.

### Project 4: [Masters Thesis]
A group of chemists came up with a novel method of measuring the viscosity of atmospheric particles, however this method was subject to very large errors. This thesis explored sources of error in the experiment using COMSOL to model the fluid flows. The sources of error were ranked to provide a systemtic means of incrementally improving the results of the experiment.

### Project 5: [Fermoral Fracture Analysis]
An assignment while at the University of Canterbury in an undegraduate Biomedical elective course studied the effect of fracture plates on bone healing. Parametric studies were applied using ANSYS to optmize fracture plate design balancing stress shielding of the bone (causes bone weakening) and callus strain (disallows bone healing).
